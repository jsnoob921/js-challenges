# 🧪 Increment operator (11/10/2023)

```javascript
let num = 15;

console.log(num++);
```

### ✅ Solution
The expected output is: `15`. 

### 📝 Explanation
The increment `(++)` operator increments (adds one to) its operand and returns the value before or after the increment, depending on where the operator is placed.

In this case, the increment will be applied after the operation.
